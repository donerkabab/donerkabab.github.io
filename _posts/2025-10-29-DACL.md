In Active Directory, **Discretionary Access Control Lists (DACLs)** decracine *who can do what* on an object. Each entry (ACE) in a DACL grants or denies permissions to a principal (user, group, or computer).

When attackers abuse misconfigured DACLs, they can escalate privileges, move laterally, or even compromise an entire domain.

The table below summarizes the **most common abusable rights** you’ll encounter in AD:

| Permission / Right | What It Means (Simplified) | Typical Abuse Example | Impact Level 🚨 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **GenericAll** | Full control over the object | Reset user password, add to group | 🔥 Domain takeover (if privileged target) |
| **GenericWrite** | Modify most attributes | Add SPN → Kerberoast, set RBCD, scriptPath | ⚠️ Escalation via creative attribute abuse |
| **WriteOwner** | Change the object owner | Take ownership → attempt to grant rights | ⚠️ Limited, depends on context |
| **WriteDACL** | Modify the object’s permissions | Grant yourself `GenericAll` or backdoor ACE | 🔥 Persistence & privilege escalation |
| **AllExtendedRights** | Perform all extended operations | Force password reset, replication operations | 🔥 User takeover or even DCSync |
| **Self / Validated Writes** | Special writes validated by AD | Add SPN to user → Kerberoastable account | ⚠️ Stealthy escalation path |
| **ForceChangePassword** | Reset password without knowing old one | Set new password on admin user | 🔥 Direct account takeover |
| **AddMember (Group)** | Add accounts to a group | Add self to Domain Admins or privileged group | 🔥 Immediate escalation |
| **Replication Rights (DCSync)** | Domain replication permissions | Perform DCSync → dump all domain credentials | 💀 Domain compromise (endgame) |

I think thats table explain everything very well lets start with **GenericAll and learn everything on user → user, user → computer etc etc.**
